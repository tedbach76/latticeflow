in particular proven to be useful or important for the use of CA as
models of real phenomena. A survey of the features of several software
packages for the simulation of CA is given. For several applications
reasonably fast simulations require the use of parallel computers. For
message passing systems connected by a reasonably fast network a
domain decomposition approach and possible optimizations are

   Based on extensive experience with concepts, theory, applications,
   and hardware and software implementations, we propose a canonical
   way to represent "programmable matter" structures such as cellular
   automata, lattice gases and related fine-grained, uniform,
   massively-parallel computational substrates. Our proposal is
   accompanied by an "exemplar" software engine which embodies our
   recommendations and makes the programmable matter paradigm
   effectively accessible to anyone provided with an ordinary
   computer.

   This initiative is intended to facilitate the design, as well as
   stimulate the exchange and dissemination, of programmable matter
   algorithms; among other things, it effects "technology transfer"
   for extensive research done in previous years by the MIT
   Information Mechanics group. In particular, the present approach
   owes much to Norman Margolus and the CAM8 project. },

    The software system JCASim is a system for simulating cellular
    automata. It can simulate cellular automata (CA) with different
    geometries, different state sets (including state sets structured by
    the use of state components with different types), boundary
    conditions and initial conditions. The state transition function can
    be specified using a graphical user-interface, using Java (by
    programming only four methods), or in CDL, a special-purpose CA
    language. Cells can be represented by text, colors, or icons. JCASim
    also provides support for block-CA and for asynchronous models. The
    system is written entirely in Java to ensure portability. Here we
    describe the simulation system and show a number of examples, which
    demonstrate the ease of programming CA with JCASim. Finally, some
    issues surrounding execution speed are discussed.}
