%We employ some naming conventions to differentiate functions
%and classes.  Ordinary functions and helper classes are lower case
%with underscores separating words as in \code{control_panel}.  In
%contrast, the STEP ops, data declarations, and functions relating
%directly to STEP are capitalized---with capital letters separating
%words as in \code{OutSignal}.  Flags are all-caps strings as in the
%console \code{'RENDER'} event hook.



% However,
% one need not give an \class{array} SIMP and STEP operations.  It is fine
% and often more convenient to use lists and tuples to represent vectors 
% and lists of lists to represent matrices and arrays.  But, SIMP and STEP 
% functions usually return arrays.
